## Introduction

This is a simple HTML and CSS template for a responsive website created for an HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) assignment. The website features a navigation menu with responsive design and some introductory content. All the buttons are functional.

## Features

1. **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring it looks and functions well on various screen sizes and devices.

2. **Navigation Menu**: A responsive navigation menu is included in the header section. It can be toggled open and closed on smaller screens for user convenience.

3. **Introductory Section**: The main content of the website is an introductory section that includes a title and a brief description welcoming visitors to the portfolio.

4. **Clickable Buttons**: The "Explore Now" button in the introductory section is clickable and serves as a call to action, directing users to another page.

## Structure and Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML content of the website.
- `style.css`: The CSS file responsible for styling the website.
- External Google Fonts are used for icons in the navigation menu.

## Navigation Links

The navigation menu includes links to different pages or sections:

- **Home**: This link points to "HomePage.html," the main landing page of the website.
- **Social Media**: Points to "SocialMedia.html," containing information about the website owner's social media presence.
- **Education**: Links to "Education.html," which likely showcases the website owner's educational background.
- **Skills**: Points to "Skills.html," where the website owner's skills and expertise are displayed.
- **Hobbies**: Links to "Hobbies.html," providing insights into the website owner's hobbies and interests.

## JavaScript Functionality

A small JavaScript script is included at the bottom of the HTML file. It provides the functionality to toggle the mobile menu:

- The `header` and `hamburgerBtn` elements are selected using `document.querySelector`.
- The script listens for a click event on the `hamburgerBtn` and toggles the `show-mobile-menu` class on the `header` element, making the navigation menu visible or hidden.
